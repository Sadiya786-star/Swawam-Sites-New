Its keeper, Elias, had lived there alone for forty years, tending the light that guided lost ships home.  \n\nOne stormy night, as Elias wound the clockwork mechanism that kept the beacon turning, he heard a knock at the door\u2014a sound he hadn\u2019t heard in decades. When he opened it, a drenched young woman stood there, clutching a rusted lantern.  \n\n\"I found this washed ashore,\" she said, shivering. \"It has your name carved into it.\"  \n\nElias\u2019s hands trembled as he took it. The lantern was his father\u2019s, lost at sea the night Elias became the keeper.  \n\n\"How?\" he whispered.  \n\nThe woman smiled sadly. \"The lighthouse calls things back\u2014lost ships, lost souls. Even memories.\"  \n\nAs the storm raged outside, Elias realized why he\u2019d never left. The island wasn\u2019t just keeping sailors safe\u2014it was keeping *him* from drifting away.  \n\nBy dawn, the woman was gone. But the lantern sat on the windowsill, its flame burning steady, as if it had never gone out.  \n\n---  \n\nLet me know if you want something sillier, darker, or just plain weird! \ud83d\ude04",
