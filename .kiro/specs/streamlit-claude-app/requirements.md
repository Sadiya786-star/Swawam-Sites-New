# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Streamlit web application that provides user authentication, prompt generation using Claude 3 Sonnet API, and user activity logging. The application will be deployment-ready for Hugging Face Spaces with a clean, modern interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log into the application with my credentials, so that I can access the prompt generation features securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login form with username and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials and clicks login THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the prompt generation page
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and remain on the login page
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store the username and login timestamp in a user_log.csv file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user login activities to be tracked and stored, so that I can monitor application usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL append the username and timestamp to user_log.csv
2. IF the user_log.csv file does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically with appropriate headers
3. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL include username, login timestamp, and any relevant session information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to enter prompts and receive AI-generated responses, so that I can interact with Claude 3 Sonnet effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the prompt page THEN the system SHALL display a text input field for prompts
2. WHEN a user enters a prompt and clicks "Generate" THEN the system SHALL send the request to Claude 3 Sonnet via OpenRouter API
3. WHEN the API responds THEN the system SHALL display the generated content to the user
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL rotate through 4 different API keys randomly to avoid rate limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to securely manage API keys and configuration, so that sensitive information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read 4 API keys from a .env file using python-dotenv
2. WHEN accessing API keys THEN the system SHALL ensure they are not hard-coded in the application
3. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL randomly select one of the 4 available API keys
4. IF the .env file is missing or keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a clean and modern interface, so that I can use it efficiently and enjoyably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, modern, and minimalistic design
2. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL use Streamlit's layout features including columns, containers, and markdown
3. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL provide a logout button for session management
4. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the system SHALL provide helpful messages and feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be deployment-ready, so that it can be easily deployed to Hugging Face Spaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for deployment THEN the system SHALL include all required imports and dependencies
2. WHEN structuring the code THEN the system SHALL be modular with separate helper functions
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include a complete requirements.txt file
4. WHEN running THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Hugging Face Spaces deployment requirements
